      <div class="section-content">

        <p>We believe the first step into professional life should feel challenging but achievable, not impossible.

    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section id="story" class="content-section">
      <h2 class="h-sg">Our Story</h2>
      
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>It started in the hallways and study rooms of Fordham's Gabelli School of Business. We were watching our classmates stress about internship applications, feeling stuck with resumes full of coursework but thin on real projects. The competition for internships had become brutal, with many positions requiring experience that students had no realistic way to get.</p>
        
        <p>At the same time, we were walking through the Bronx and Manhattan, passing small businesses that clearly needed help. Coffee shops with outdated websites. Nonprofits that could benefit from social media strategy. Local retail stores that needed better customer communication. These business owners were smart and hardworking, but they were stretched thin, too busy running their operations to tackle marketing projects, and too cost conscious to hire expensive agencies.</p>
        
        <div class="story-highlight card">
          <p>The insight hit us during a late night conversation in the Gabelli building: there was a match hiding in plain sight. Students who needed real experience, and businesses that needed practical help. The gap was not about ability or motivation on either side, it was about connection and structure.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>We started talking to other students, professors, and local business owners. The feedback was immediate and clear: students were desperate for ways to apply what they were learning in class to real situations, and small businesses had running lists of important projects that somehow never got done. Everyone could see the logic, but no one had created a systematic way to make these connections happen safely and fairly.</p>
        
        <p>PrePair began as our solution to a problem we were living ourselves. Instead of trying to build something global from day one, we decided to start hyper local at Fordham, in New York City, with the businesses and students we could actually see and support.</p>

    <!-- What We Believe -->
    <section id="beliefs" class="content-section">
      <h2 class="h-sg">What We Believe</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">PrePair is built on a few simple beliefs that guide everything we do.</p>
      
      <div class="beliefs-grid">
        <div class="belief-item card">
          <h4>Real work teaches best.</h4>
          <p>Students learn fastest when they work on real problems for real people, not only simulated cases. There is something different about knowing that your work will actually be used by a business owner who is counting on you to deliver.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="belief-item card">
          <h4>Opportunity should not depend on connections.</h4>
          <p>Access to early experience should not be limited to students whose families already know people in the right fields. PrePair creates structured pathways that work for students from any background.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="belief-item card">
          <h4>Small businesses deserve access to talent.</h4>
          <p>Local business owners and organizations should not have to choose between doing everything alone or hiring expensive agencies. Motivated students can provide real value while learning from experienced mentors.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="belief-item card">
          <h4>International students need practical paths.</h4>
          <p>Students from other countries should have realistic ways to gain U.S. experience in structured, educational settings that align with their visa requirements and academic goals.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="belief-item card">
          <h4>The first step should feel possible.</h4>
          <p>Taking the first real step into the professional world should feel challenging but achievable. We design projects that stretch students without overwhelming them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="belief-item card">
          <h4>Education and ethics come first.</h4>
          <p>Projects are framed around learning and development, not replacing paid jobs. Students are treated as learners gaining valuable experience, not as free labor.</p>

        <p>PrePair is founded and led by undergraduate students at Fordham University's Gabelli School of Business. This is not a side detail, it is central to what makes PrePair work.</p>
        
        <p>We live the same reality as the students PrePair serves. We see up close how stressful internship competition has become and how many capable students feel stuck without early professional experience. We understand what it is like to have knowledge from business classes but limited opportunities to apply it in real situations. We know the specific challenges international students face in gaining U.S. experience within educational guidelines.</p>
        
        <p>At the same time, we are surrounded by small businesses throughout New York City that are constantly stretched for time and resources. We see restaurant owners who need help with social media, nonprofit leaders who could benefit from strategic planning support, and retail shops that need customer communication improvements. Our perspective as students in the city gives us direct insight into both sides of the equation.</p>
        
        <div class="gabelli-highlight card">
          <p>The Gabelli School environment helped us refine PrePair into something more than just a good idea. Through entrepreneurship courses, case competitions, and guidance from professors who pushed us to think seriously about ethics and impact, we developed a framework that prioritizes education and fairness. Being students is not a limitation in building PrePair, it is our biggest advantage in understanding exactly what students and local businesses need.</p>

          <div class="timeline-item card">
            <h4>Short term</h4>
            <p>We are building the strongest possible version of PrePair at Fordham and in New York City. This means creating meaningful experiences for our early student and business users, refining our matching process, and developing support systems that help both students and business owners succeed. We are listening carefully to feedback and improving the platform based on real use rather than assumptions.</p>

            <p>We plan to expand thoughtfully to additional campuses that share similar needs and local business ecosystems. Rather than scaling quickly everywhere, we want to prove that the PrePair model works consistently before moving to new markets. This phase will also involve improving our tools for project design, communication, and tracking outcomes so that future expansion builds on solid foundations.</p>

          <div class="timeline-item card">
            <h4>Long term</h4>

We want to build a network where campuses and local business communities are meaningfully connected, where students graduate with real experience and confidence, and where small businesses have reliable access to motivated talent.</p>

        <p>Our ambitions are big, but they are grounded in what PrePair already is: a practical solution to real problems that students and business owners face every day.
