    <!-- Why Extra Hands -->

      <h2 class="h-sg">Why owners look for extra hands</h2>
      
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>Your business has a running list of important tasks that somehow never get done. Update the website copy. Plan some Instagram posts. Research what competitors are doing. Get customer feedback on that new service idea. These aren't urgent enough to drop everything, but they'd genuinely help your business if someone just handled them.</p>
        
        <p>The problem is the gap between "we really should do this" and "we can afford to hire someone for it." Bringing on staff means payroll, benefits, and long-term commitments you might not be ready for. Agencies and freelancers often charge more than your entire monthly marketing budget for projects that should be straightforward.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, these tasks pile up on your already full plate. PrePair exists specifically in that gap—giving you access to motivated talent for projects that are important but not mission-critical, at a price that makes sense for small businesses.</p>

          <h3>Social media content planning</h3>
          <p>A marketing or communications student creates two weeks of Instagram posts for your coffee shop, including captions and photo suggestions. You get fresh content ideas and they learn about brand voice and social strategy for a real business.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-card card">
          <h3>Website copy refresh</h3>
          <p>A business or English student rewrites your "About Us" and services pages to make them clearer and more engaging. You get professional-quality copy and they gain experience writing for real clients with real business goals.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-card card">
          <h3>Customer research project</h3>
          <p>A business student surveys your customers about what additional services they'd want, then presents findings in a simple report with recommendations. You get valuable insights and they practice research methods on a real business challenge.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-card card">
          <h3>Email newsletter setup</h3>
          <p>A marketing student helps you set up an email newsletter system and creates the first few issues of content. You finally launch that newsletter you've been planning and they learn about email marketing in practice.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-card card">
          <h3>Process improvement analysis</h3>
          <p>A business or operations student analyzes your customer intake process and suggests improvements with simple templates. You streamline operations and they gain hands-on experience with business process optimization.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example-card card">
          <h3>Brand asset creation</h3>
          <p>A design student creates simple marketing materials like flyers or social media templates using your existing brand guidelines. You get professional-looking materials and they build their portfolio with real client work.</p>

    <!-- Time and Oversight -->
    <section id="time-oversight" class="content-section">
      <h2 class="h-sg">How much time and oversight it really takes</h2>
      
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>The most common concern business owners have is: "Will managing a student become another full-time job?" The answer is no, but students do need some guidance—that's part of the educational value.</p>
        
        <p>Projects are intentionally designed to be manageable for busy owners. They're scoped to focus on specific deliverables, limited in hours (typically 10-30 total), and structured so they enhance rather than interfere with your daily operations.</p>
        
        <p>Here's what's typically expected from you as a host: an initial conversation to clarify the project scope and expectations, availability to answer questions when they come up (usually via message, not constant meetings), and time to review work at key milestones and provide feedback.</p>
        
        <div class="time-commitment card">
          <h3>Typical time commitment from your side:</h3>
          <ul class="time-list">
            <li>45-60 minutes to define the project and brief the student</li>
            <li>15-20 minutes every few days for questions and quick check-ins</li>
            <li>30-45 minutes for final review and feedback</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="time-note">Most owners find this manageable because the projects are designed to be self-contained rather than integrated into critical business operations.</p>

        <p>PrePair isn't a replacement for professional staff or agencies when you need expert-level work. It's positioned as a practical middle ground for tasks that are important but not urgent enough to justify major investment.</p>
        
        <div class="comparison-table">
          <h3>Here's how the options compare:</h3>
          <div class="comparison-grid">
            <div class="comparison-item">
              <h4>Hiring full-time staff</h4>
              <p>Higher ongoing costs with payroll, benefits, and long-term commitment. Makes sense when you have 30+ hours of work per week in a specific area. Requires HR processes, training, and management overhead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item">
              <h4>Freelancers and agencies</h4>
              <p>Professional-quality work but often $50-150+ per hour or $1,000+ per project. Best when you need expert-level results and have the budget. Less opportunity for ongoing relationship building.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-item">
              <h4>PrePair</h4>
              <p>$20/month subscription with projects completed by motivated students. Educational framework means students are learning while helping your business. Opportunity to mentor future talent and potentially identify future hires. Best for moving forward on important but non-critical projects.</p>

        <div class="faq-column">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Do I have to pay students directly?</h4>
            <p>No, students are not paid for PrePair projects. This is an educational framework where students gain experience, portfolio pieces, and mentorship. You pay only the monthly platform subscription.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>What makes unpaid projects fair to students?</h4>
            <p>Students are the primary beneficiaries—they're gaining real experience, portfolio material, and professional references that help them land paid internships and jobs later. The projects are structured as educational experiences with clear learning outcomes.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>How many hours should a typical project take?</h4>
            <p>Most projects range from 15-40 total hours over 2-6 weeks, which breaks down to about 5-15 hours per week. You'll see time estimates when reviewing student applications and can adjust scope accordingly.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>What if the student doesn't finish or the work isn't usable?</h4>
            <p>We provide support to help resolve issues and can connect you with alternative students if needed. Most problems stem from unclear initial expectations, which is why we emphasize thorough project scoping upfront.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Can I offer a bonus or stipend if I'm happy with the work?</h4>
            <p>While projects are designed to be unpaid educational experiences, some businesses choose to offer small thank-you gifts, recommendations, or future paid opportunities. This should be discussed openly with students.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="faq-column">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Can successful projects lead to paid internships or jobs?</h4>
            <p>Absolutely. Many businesses use PrePair to evaluate potential talent for future paid positions. It's a low-risk way to see how someone works before making hiring commitments.</p>

            <h4>How much experience do students typically have?</h4>
            <p>Students range from first-years exploring interests to seniors with some internship experience. We help match student experience levels with appropriate project complexity. Many projects are designed specifically for motivated beginners.</p>
