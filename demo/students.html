      <h2 class="h-sg">Why this first step matters</h2>
      
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>Internships have changed. They're competitive, often require experience you don't have yet, and many applications feel like throwing your resume into a black hole. You're told to "get experience" but no one explains where that first experience is supposed to come from.</p>
        
        <p>If you're feeling behind compared to classmates who already have internships or family connections, you're not alone. Most students don't know what counts as "real experience" or how to move beyond school projects that don't feel substantial enough for a resume.</p>
        
        <p>PrePair exists because there's no longer a reliable, structured first step. We designed it to be exactly that—your bridge from classroom theory to real-world practice.</p>

      <h2 class="h-sg">How PrePair fits with internships and jobs</h2>
      
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>PrePair isn't a replacement for internships—it's designed as the foundation that makes you a stronger candidate when you do apply for them.</p>
        
        <p>The sequence we envision: First, you complete 1-3 projects through PrePair over a semester or two. Then, you use those projects to apply for internships and entry-level jobs with actual experience to discuss. Instead of talking only about class projects or part-time jobs unrelated to your field, you'll have real client work to reference.</p>
        
        <p>These projects serve three purposes: they make your resume less empty, give you concrete stories for interviews, and help you discover whether you actually enjoy certain types of work before committing to longer-term positions.</p>
        
        <div class="comparison-table">
          <h3>PrePair projects vs. traditional internships:</h3>

      <h2 class="h-sg">International students and access</h2>
      
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>International students often face strict regulations about work and limited clarity about what kinds of experience are allowed. Many feel stuck watching domestic students build experience through paid internships or jobs that aren't available to them.</p>
        
        <p>PrePair was designed with international students specifically in mind. Because projects are unpaid and structured as educational experiences with clear learning outcomes, they fit within the framework of academic enrichment rather than employment. You're gaining practical skills and portfolio pieces while staying within educational guidelines.</p>
        
        <p>We can't guarantee compliance with every individual visa situation, but the structure is intentionally educational: you're the primary beneficiary, learning through mentorship-style projects that complement your coursework. The small business benefits too, but the focus is on your development and learning.</p>

    <!-- Pricing -->

      <div class="pricing-card card">
        <h3>About $2 per month gets you:</h3>
        <ul class="pricing-features">
          <li>Access to browse and apply for projects with local businesses</li>
          <li>Profile tools to showcase your skills and track completed projects</li>
          <li>Direct messaging with business owners during projects</li>
          <li>A portfolio section where you can document your work and get feedback</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="pricing-note">The price is intentionally low because we believe access to real experience shouldn't depend on your financial background. This isn't about making money from students—it's about creating a sustainable way to connect you with meaningful opportunities.</p>

      <div class="faq-grid">
        <div class="faq-column">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Do I get paid for projects?</h4>
            <p>No, PrePair projects are unpaid educational experiences. You're gaining skills, portfolio pieces, and connections rather than immediate income. Think of it as structured practice that prepares you for paid opportunities later.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>How many hours does a typical project take?</h4>
            <p>Most projects require 5-10 hours per week over 2-6 weeks, totaling about 15-40 hours. This varies by project type, and you can see time expectations before applying so you can choose what fits your schedule.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Can first-year students use PrePair, or should I wait?</h4>
            <p>First-year students are absolutely welcome. Many of our projects are designed for students who are just starting to explore their interests. The key is enthusiasm and willingness to learn, not existing expertise.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>How many projects can I do at once?</h4>
            <p>We recommend focusing on one project at a time, especially when you're starting out. This lets you give quality attention to the work and the mentorship relationship. After completing 1-2 projects successfully, you might consider taking on multiple shorter projects.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Can I still use PrePair if I already have an internship?</h4>
            <p>Yes, many students use PrePair projects to explore different fields or build skills outside their main internship focus. Just make sure you can manage the time commitment for both.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-column">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>What if I don't know what I'm good at yet?</h4>
            <p>That's exactly why PrePair exists. Short projects let you try different types of work—marketing, research, design, writing—without major commitments. You'll discover your strengths through doing, not just thinking.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>What if the project goes badly or the business stops responding?</h4>
            <p>We help mediate any issues that arise and can connect you with alternative projects if needed. Most problems come from unclear expectations, which is why we emphasize communication upfront. In rare cases where projects don't work out, we help you find a better fit.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>How does this help with future internship or job applications?</h4>
            <p>You'll have specific examples to discuss in interviews, concrete work to show in portfolios, and professional references who can speak to your work quality and reliability. Instead of saying "I think I'd be good at this," you can say "I did similar work for X business and here's what I accomplished."</p>

            <h4>I'm an international student. Is this safe for me to do?</h4>
            <p>PrePair projects are structured as educational experiences, not employment, which is why they can work for international students. However, you should always verify with your international student advisor that any activities align with your specific visa requirements.</p>

            <h4>Do I need a perfect GPA or lots of experience to use PrePair?</h4>
            <p>No. We care more about your willingness to learn, communicate professionally, and meet commitments than your GPA or existing experience. Small businesses want reliable, enthusiastic help—not necessarily expertise.</p>

        <p>PrePair is a way to stop waiting for "someday" and start building experience now, while you're still in school and have time to explore what interests you.</p>
        <p>If you're ready to move beyond theoretical classwork and want to see what it feels like to complete real projects for real clients, this is your first step. If you're an international student looking for ways to gain U.S. experience within your guidelines, or a domestic student who wants to build confidence before applying for competitive internships, PrePair gives you a structured path forward.</p>
